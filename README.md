# Optimal Routing of Electrical Networks using Heuristic Techniques and Graph Algorithms.
This Repository hosts our B.Tech Final year project.

## Osmium and Data Acquisition
we are using osmium to extract latitude and longitude location from a ".osm" file and then use algorithms to convert those data points into required formats


## 3-Layer Model
This model includes the follwing parts:
1. Optimal Transformer Location
2. Optimal LV Lines from end User to Transformer
3. Optimal MV lines between transformers.
