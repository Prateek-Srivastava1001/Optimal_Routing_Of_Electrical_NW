# Problem Statement
The unpredictable increase in electricity demand has challenged the design and planning of
any electrical system in transmission or distribution level. The population growth, migration
and city planning had reduced the performance of the Electric Distribution Systems (EDS) in
large cities, especially in third world countries.
This Project tackles this increase in demand by automating the process of Implementing EDS
systems with formal considerations of planning and/or project demand in view of
georeferenced data.

# Overview
This project aims to implement a system to find the optimal routing of an electrical distribution
system. This Project employs the PRIM algorithm as a graph search heuristic. The system routes
an electrical distribution network in a georeferenced area, taking into account the
characteristics of the terrain, such as streets or intersections, and scenarios without squared
streets.
